    <h2> Danny</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone. My name is Daniel Vazquez, but I go by Danny. I'm a Southern California native
        by birth, and I know live in Utah. I'm currently majoring in BS in Tech, and I'm working towards 
        going into the QA field.</p>
        <p>I have been married for the last 7 months, and its been an amazing time with my wife. Some of my hobbies 
        are watching movies, waching soccer games, and the one I'm mostly known for by family and friends is
        working on cars.</p>
        <p>I currenyly work for a company called Nu Skin in their Digital Department, and I run a small auto 
        detail company on the side. Working for Nu Skin and this specific department it helped me realize I wanted
        to go into QA.</p>
        <p>I've been a memeber of The Church of Jesus Christ since I was born. I love how the gospel can help us be 
        better version of ourselves. I served a Mission in the Mendonza Aregneitna Mission back in 2008. </p>
        <p> Just a test</p>
